# Node Recorder

## Intro
This is a reference code, not the one for the assignment.

Please refer to these codes (recoder.py, loader.py) and make your own code to 1) receive odom messages, 2) manage nodes, and 3) visualize the nodes through Rviz (e.g., by using Marker messages).

## Odom subscriber part (script/recorder.py)
Refer to the following part to receice odometry messages.

## Node visualization part (script/loader.py)
Refer to the following part to visualize your nodes through Marker-type messages.
